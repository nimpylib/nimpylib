# Some Python Notations that must be rewritten externally

This folder collects
some python notations that must be rewritten outside of `NimPyLib`.

Maybe useful for translating Python code to Nim.

## file format

```markdown
## desc
## rewrite
```

and `rewrite` section contains several code blocks in BNF format,
with the pattern to match and the rewitten result splitted by `->`.
